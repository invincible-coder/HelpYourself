# HelpYourself

## How Does it Work?
- HelpYourself quantifies the difference in a user's actual and ideal stress/anxiety/depression level as credits to be spent on a prescribed set of activities before the day ends. By doing so, users inadvertently take actionable steps to deal with their condition.

- Users then decide on the activities to spend their credits on, the reward they get for completing them (to positively reinforce the habit of taking actionable steps to deal with their condition), and a time for HelpYourself to notify them to check back in.

- When users check back in, HelpYourself prompts them to reward themselves, then proceeds to re-evaluate their stress/anxiety/depression levels.
